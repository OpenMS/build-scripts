Nightly builds on mac os x should be executed as LaunchAgent to enable GUI tests. 

Simply edit the accompanying de.openms.NightlyDashboard.plist file to match 
your configuration and copy it to $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/

Execute 

$ launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/de.openms.NightlyDashboard.plist

to enable the LaunchAgent. After a reboot it will be automatically reloaded.
